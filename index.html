The riskiest bet, with the highest potential upside, is our bet to focus on [some opportunity] by trying to [some intervention]. We will [know/be more confident] this was the right bet if we observe [some leading indicator]. We can actively de-risk this bet by [some approach to de-risking].","We believe that [increasing/decreasing] some activity causes [increases/decreases] in some [key performance metric, financial metric, etc.] There are a number of assumptions/factors underpinning that causal relationship including [factors, caveats, assumptions].","As a company we are making many implicit and explicit bets. Our biggest implicit (assumed, unspoken) bet is [some version of the future, impact of an intervention, etc.] This bet has major ramifications across the company including [how bet influences various teams].  The impact of this bet being wrong would be [some major, company-wide adverse impact]. The upside of being right would be [some major, company-wide positive impact]. To increase our chance of realizing the upside we will [some activity].","In the not-so-distant future we will see the commodification of [some customer/user need, technology service, etc.]. There will be a lowering of prices, and a focus on scale and reliability. This will present the following opportunities: [ways to exploit this shift to commodification], but also trigger the following challenges: [threats to mitigate].","We believe that by focusing on [some intervention] we will make it possible for customers to [achieve some outcome] more [efficiently, accurately, joyfully, effectively], which we believe will benefit the business by [some business benefit, or causal chain].","Operationally, we know we have been been deprioritizing [some process, system, activity]. We realize this causes pain and frustration to our people by [some observable pain points, frustration]. The important bet that we hope will offset this short-term pain is that we are [some larger, valuable bet].","We are betting that customers will continue to use our product because [some value proposition] despite the fact that other products are more [positive attributes of competitive products].","You could call [some set of interventions, or class of interventions] as our “safe bet”.
